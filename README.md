## About
CricShot10k is a research project aimed at creating a large-scale dataset for classifying different types of cricket shots. It also introduces an automated data-collection method, where full-length match videos are automatically split into individual shot clips. This removes the major bottleneck of manually trimming footage, which is slow and time-consuming. In addition, a modified framework is proposed to further improve shot-classification accuracy.
