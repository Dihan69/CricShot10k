## About
CricShot10k is a research project aimed at creating a large-scale dataset for classifying different types of cricket shots. It also introduces an automated data-collection method, where full-length match videos are automatically split into individual shot clips. This removes the major bottleneck of manually trimming footage, which is slow and time-consuming. In addition, a modified framework is proposed to further improve shot-classification accuracy.

## Dataset Demo

A Google Drive link has been added as a demo, containing 5 randomly selected videos from each class: [Demo Videos on Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bQd1shtQCnGI1uwrhSw8AB-esi-Xkz_C?usp=drive_link)


## Dataset Link

The Google Drive link for the full dataset is available at [Full Dataset on Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13dQHHW8v9gt_jIssQ5PTrJToWGUXvZey?usp=drive_link). Each class is in a separate compressed archive, and you need to download them to view the full dataset. Note that the dataset is intended solely for non-commercial research purposes, and the copyright of the original videos remains with the respective rights holders.

Each of our videos is numbered from 1–536 based on the original match videos they were collected from. The list of match videos can be found here: [Match Videos Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q8bdNIEX9vDCJiFbykNoNb0VNoeNupNwrM-AZHLBXSg/edit)
