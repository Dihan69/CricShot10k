## About
CricShot10k is a research project aimed at creating a large-scale dataset for classifying different types of cricket shots. It also introduces an automated data-collection method, where full-length match videos are automatically split into individual shot clips. This removes the major bottleneck of manually trimming footage, which is slow and time-consuming. In addition, a modified framework is proposed to further improve shot-classification accuracy.

## Dataset Demo

A Google Drive link has been added as a demo, containing 15 randomly selected videos from each class: [Demo Videos on Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1aRugfvXu1TiiUgbskj5A6Iyv3MHUFSw6?usp=sharing)

Each of our videos is numbered from 1–536 based on the main match videos they were collected from. The list of match videos can be found here: [Match Videos Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q8bdNIEX9vDCJiFbykNoNb0VNoeNupNwrM-AZHLBXSg/edit)




## Dataset Link
A HuggingFace or Goggle Drive Link would be provided with each shot sorted classwise in different folders after the publication of the paper.
